<img class="float-left" style="width:225px; margin-right:10px;" src="http://michael.bishop.net.za/storage/app/media/mjb.png"><p>Welcome :) I'm Michael Bishop - husband, father of three and Methodist minister working in <a href="https://www.umc.org.za" target="_blank">a local church in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-5" target="_blank">five on the Enneagram,</a> my natural default is to observe and reflect (the name of the blog points to the <a href="https://www.ignatianspirituality.com/ignatian-prayer/the-examen/consciousness-examen/" target="_blank">reflection practice of St Ignatius</a>). I also feel a compulsive need to gather information and resources - the thought of lessons being learned somewhere and not being recorded makes me feel uneasy :) So maintaining this site is mostly free therapy for me ... but if you find anything helpful here, that will be great too!</p>
<p>At the moment, the site is mostly a blog - many of these entries are also published through our church website - but I will also be adding more video resources - a combination of spirituality / training resources and tech tutorials.</p>
<p>You can contact me via <a href="https://twitter.com/MJ_Bishop" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or by commenting on the site (once the comment system is working!).</p>
